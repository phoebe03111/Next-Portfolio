              I discovered a love for software engineering in 2021 while
              exploring new career paths after moving to Canada during the
              COVID-19 pandemic.

              After several months of self-teaching, I enrolled in a bootcamp
              and eventually transitioned into a role as a teaching assistant.
              Upon graduation, I worked as a full-stack developer at a marketing
              startup, where I honed my skills and had a blast turning ideas
              into code.

              Outside of work, I enjoy hip-hop dancing, hiking, and traveling to
              new places (and find the best coffee shops in town ‚òïÔ∏è)

              With a passion for front-end engineering, I am eager to pivot
              towards new opportunities and thrive in a dynamic and
              collaborative environment. If you think you&apos;ve got an opening
